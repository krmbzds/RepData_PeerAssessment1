# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data

Read csv file as a data frame, remove incomplete cases:

```{r, tidy=FALSE}
data <- unz("activity.zip", "activity.csv")  # Unzip file
data <- read.csv2(data, sep = ",")           # Read file as data frame
data <- data[complete.cases(data), ]         # Remove incomplete cases
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
